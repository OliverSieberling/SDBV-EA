This repository contains the code for calculating hitting times and generating figures in my bachelor's thesis 

 - [Dynamic monotone functions on the (1+1)-EA: Drift minimization does not maximize hardness](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/jkGGklDlNdYuz0b)
  
and the paper 
- [Hardest Monotone Functions for Evolutionary Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07438)
  
by M. Kaufmann, M. Larcher, J. Lengler, and O. Sieberling.

# How to use

- simulation_notebooks: jupyter notebooks used to generate Figure 3 and Figure 4 (paper)
- simulation_output_files: output files generated by running simulations.cpp and poeaSim.cpp, which were used for generating Figure 3 and Figure 4 (paper)
- simulations.cpp: code used to generate output files in SimulationOutputFiles (all except PO-EA)
- poea_simulation.cpp: code used to generate output files in SimulationOutputFiles (only PO-EA)
